# Terraform workspace example
First create the workspaces that we need, they were formerly known as environments but was changed since people found it too confusing.
``` shell
terraform workspace new development
terraform workspace new production
```
We can then select a workspace and initialise and apply our configuration based on the tfvars for each environment.
First we setup the development environment.
``` shell
terraform workspace select development
terraform plan --var-file=development.tfvars
terraform apply --var-file=development.tfvars
```
And then we create the production environment.
``` shell
terraform workspace select production
terraform plan --var-file=production.tfvars
terraform apply --var-file=production.tfvars
```
If we go to the S3 bucket containing our remote state files we can see that a new folder structured has been created.
It will contain a folder for each environment with a subfolder for each terraform project and its state file.
- env:/
    - development/
        - terraform-workspace-example/
            - terraform.state
    - production/
        - terraform-workspace-example/
            - terraform.state
